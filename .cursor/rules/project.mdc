Next.js 15 App Router structure (Server/Client Components).

Use feature-first file organization; group by domain/feature.

Logical separation for auth, profile, post, feed, storage, etc.

Decouple UI (components), logic (hooks/services), and data (Supabase models).

One export per file; prefer named exports.
