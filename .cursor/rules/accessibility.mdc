Default UI in Polish, but all code-level naming in English.

Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, focus rings, and preserve landmark structure.

Ensure color contrast, alt text on images, and keyboard navigation.

Internationalization (i18n) must follow Next.js conventions and handle date/number formatting.
